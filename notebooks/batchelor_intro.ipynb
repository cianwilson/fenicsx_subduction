    "The solid flow in a subduction zone is primarily driven by the motion of the downgoing slab entraining material in the mantle wedge and dragging it down with it setting up a cornerflow in the mantle wedge.

    "\n",
    "An important aspect of ${\\bf S}$ is that it describes a so-called \"saddle point\" system. The lower right block is zero, which indicates that pressure is acting in this system as a Lagrange multiplier, enforcing the constraint that the velocity is divergence free but not appearing in the continuity equation itself.  Such systems require special consideration of the choice of shape functions for the discrete approximations of velocity and pressure to ensure the stability of the solution, ${\\bf u}$.  Several choices of so-called stable element pairs, $(\\vec{\\omega}_j, \\chi_j)$ are available in the literature (e.g. [Auricchio, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119176817.ecm2004)).  Here we select the frequently used lowest-order Taylor-Hood element pair, in which $\\vec{\\omega}_j$ are piecewise-quadratic  and $\\chi_j$ are piecewise-linear polynomials, referred to on triangular (and tetrahedral in 3D) meshes as P2P1.  This fulfills a necessary (but not sufficient) criterion for stability that the velocity has more DOFs than the pressure."
