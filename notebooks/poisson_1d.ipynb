    "The rate at which this decreases is known as the order of convergence. Numerical analysis predicts a certain order depending on the type of the polynomials used as finite element shape functions and other constraints related to the well-posedness of the problem. For piecewise linear shape functions we expect second-order convergence, that is that the error decreases as $h^{-2}$ where $h$ is the nodal point spacing. With piecewise quadratic elements we expect to see third-order convergence."
